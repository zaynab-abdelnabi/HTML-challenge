        <h1>Khalifa Tower</h1>

        <h3>What is Khalifa Tower?</h3>
        <p><b>Burj Khalifa</b>, Khalifa also spelled <u>Khalīfah</u>, mixed-use skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab
            Emirates, that is the
            world’s tallest building, according to all three of the main criteria by which such buildings are judged
            (see Researcher’s Note: Heights of Buildings). Burj Khalifa (“Khalifa Tower”), known during construction as
            Burj Dubai, was officially named to honour the leader of the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh
            Khalifa ibn Zayed Al Nahyan. Although the tower was formally opened on January 4, 2010, the entirety of the
            interior was not complete at that time. Built to house a variety of commercial, residential, and hospitality
            ventures, the tower—whose intended height remained a closely guarded secret throughout its
            construction—reached completion at 162 floors and a height of 2,717 feet (828 metres). It was designed by
            the Chicago-based architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Adrian Smith served as architect, and
            William F. Baker served as structural engineer.

        <h3>How did Khalifa Tower build?</h3>
        <p>
            Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The
            primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from
            the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in
            2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of
            large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is based on the government's
            decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The
            building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president
            of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai
            money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest
            building in the world.

            Burj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whose firm designed the Willis
            Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group
            Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived
            from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite
            floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are
            used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj
            Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of
            the wings.The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot
            summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.

            "Burj Khalifa goes beyond its imposing physical specifications. In Burj Khalifa, we see the triumph of Dubai's vision of attaining the seemingly impossible
            and setting new benchmarks. It is a source of inspiration for every one of us at Emaar. The project is a
            declaration of the Emirate's capabilities and of the resolve of its leaders and people to work hand-in-hand
            on truly awe-inspiring projects."
