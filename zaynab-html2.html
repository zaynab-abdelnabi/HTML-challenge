        <h1>Definition</h1>
        <p>
            Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
            flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
            ingredients
            (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high
            temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person
            who
            makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

            Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome
            challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be
            frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising
            crusts.

        <h1>Pizza and Health</h1>
        <p>
            Some mass-produced pizzas by pizza chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of
            ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt, fat, and calories. The USDA reports an average sodium content of
            5,101 mg per 36 cm (14 in) pizza in fast food chains. There are concerns about negative health
            effects.

            Frequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular
            disease and digestive tract cancers relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although the nature of the
            association between pizza and such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza consumption in Italy might only
            indicate adherence to traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, which have been shown to have various
            health benefits.
        </p>

            Some attribute the apparent health benefits of pizza to the lycopene content in pizza sauce,which
            research indicates likely plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and various cancers
